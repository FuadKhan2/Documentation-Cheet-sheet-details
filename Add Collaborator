# Steps for Your Teammate to Add You as a Collaborator to a Public Repository:

1. **Go to the Repository**:
   - Your teammate needs to navigate to the **GitHub repository** they want to grant you access to.

2. **Open the Settings**:
   - On the right side of the repository page, your teammate should click on the **Settings** tab (this option is only visible to repository owners and collaborators).

3. **Navigate to the Collaborators & Teams Section**:
   - In the settings menu, on the left-hand side, your teammate should scroll down and find the **Manage Access** section.
   - They need to click on **Collaborators & teams**.

4. **Invite a Collaborator**:
   - Under the **Collaborators** section, there is an **Invite a collaborator** button. Your teammate should click it.
   
5. **Add Your GitHub Username**:
   - In the invite field, your teammate will enter your **GitHub username**.
   - Once your username appears in the search results, they can click on your profile and send you an invitation.

6. **Accept the Invitation**:
   - You will receive an email notification and a notification on GitHub asking you to accept the collaboration invitation.
   - Once you accept the invitation, you will have **write access** to the repository, meaning you can push changes directly to it.

### After Being Added as a Collaborator:
- Once you’ve accepted the invitation, you can directly **push changes** to the repository without the need to fork it.
- You can follow these Git commands to add, commit, and push your changes:
   ```sh
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your commit message"
   git push origin main  # or the appropriate branch you're working on
   ```

---

### Summary:
- Your teammate needs to add you as a collaborator in the **repository settings**.
- You’ll receive an invitation to accept, after which you’ll have **write access** to the repository and can push directly to it.
